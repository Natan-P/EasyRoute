# EasyRoute

An easy-to-use program that automatically generates "routing puzzles".
These are puzzles where you get an instruction set of cardinal directions,
where one has to follow there instructions to get to the end.

Until now, we have had to make these puzzles by hand, which of course
brings human error.
